# Fun With Angular

For a long time I have kept my distance with Javascript frameworks.

When I started my career, Javascript is what was used to validate forms. I put my focus on Java. Shortly into my Java experience I discovered the Spring Framework. It was love at first site. My focus has been here for years.

A few years back I checked out JQuery and was really impressed. Using this and Bootstrap let me build things I had only dreamed about.

Recently I decided to poke around and learn a full Javascript framework.

My test for things like this is too jump into them right away and try and make something work.

I looked a few and really liked Angular. I have noticed that there is a 2.0 of Angular that seems different than all the books, blogs and tutorials out there. I decided to ignore that for now and play with the version of the framework that has been around the longest.

This repo is me having some fun with Angular :-)
