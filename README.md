# Fun With Angular

For a long time I have kept my distance with Javascript frameworks.

When I started my career, Javascript is what was used to validate forms. I put my focus on Java. Shortly into my Java experience I discovered the Spring Framework. It was love at first site. My focus has been here for years.

A few years back I checked out JQuery and was really impressed. Using this and Bootstrap let me build things I had only dreamed about.

Recently I decided to poke around and learn a full Javascript framework.

When evaluating technology like this, my approach is to just jump in and start trying to make things work and see where I get. I looked a few and really liked Angular. I'm in no position to say its better than anything else, Angular and me just clicked in terms of just being able to build cool stuff without much learning curve. Maybe there is better stuff out there, but for now this is the one that is working for me :-)

I have noticed that there is a 2.0 of Angular that seems different than all the books, blogs and tutorials out there. I decided to ignore that for now and play with the version of the framework that has been around the longest. Again, not really sure about the history of Angular, this choice is based on there be more resources for the first version of the framework.

This repo is me having some fun with Angular :-)
